Description: console password management application
 Pwman3 aims to provide a simple but powerful command line interface for
 password management. It allows one to store passwords in a sqlite database
 locked by a master password which can be encrypted with different algorithms
 (e.g Blowfish, AES, DES3).
 .
 It is also possible to tag them to ease searches in a large amount of
 passwords
